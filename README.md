# TaxiTracker Project

---

## Overview

The **TaxiTracker** project is a practical implementation of a database system designed for a default taxi fleet.
Its purpose is to demonstrate real-world application of backend development principles, **using the Django framework** as the foundation for the entire implementation.

---

## Key Features and Skills Practiced

### 1. REST API Development

* Implementation of a fully functional REST API **based on Django REST Framework (DRF)** for interacting with fleet data.
* Endpoints for managing vehicles, drivers, trips, and related entities.
* Use of serializers, viewsets, and permissions within Django’s architecture.

### 2. Data Protection and Security

* Application of methods to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
* Integration of authentication and permission systems to restrict actions to authorized users only.
* Practical configuration of Django’s built-in authentication mechanisms.

### 3. Access Level Control

* Differentiation of database visibility and access based on user roles (e.g., manager, driver, admin).
* Enforcement of object-level permissions for secure and efficient data access.
* Role-based access control implemented through Django’s ORM and permission system.

### 4. Database Architecture Design

* Practical experience in designing and normalizing relational database structures.
* Definition of relationships between key entities such as vehicles, enterprises, and employees.
* Optimization of query performance and data integrity constraints using Django ORM.
* Project architecture fully designed and managed through **Django models and migrations**.

### 5. Additional Practical Skills

* Acquired hands-on experience with **Faker** for generating realistic test data.
* Implemented **pagination** for REST API responses to improve scalability and performance.
* Partially practiced **frontend concepts**, including organizing navigation buttons within REST API responses.
* Applied the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle throughout the project for maintainable and clean code.
* Gained experience working with **cURL** and **Postman** for testing and debugging API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

* **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)** — core backend framework
* **Python** — primary programming language
* **PostgreSQL** — database management system
* **Docker** (optional) — for containerized deployment
* **JWT Authentication** — secure token-based access for API users

---

## Project Goals

* Strengthen backend development and database design skills.
* Gain hands-on experience with **Django and DRF** as production-grade tools.
* Build a scalable, secure, and well-structured API for managing taxi fleet data.
